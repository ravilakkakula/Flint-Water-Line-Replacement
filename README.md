# Flint-water-line-replacement
Helping Flint city board to save up costs to replace the lead pipes.

Contributed to the Flint Water Line Replacement project by collecting, cleaning, and processing data, and performing
exploratory data analysis to identify key factors like house age related to lead service lines.

Developed and evaluated machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks, to
predict lead contamination risk, deploying the Bootstrap Forest Model based on ROC AUC scores.
